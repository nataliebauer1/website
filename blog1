<p> At first glance, stickers might seem trivial: funny, aesthetic, or vehicles for political claims by groups no one really wants to listen to anyway, right? But, it’s not <i>that</i> simple.
For instance, stickers can function as marks. Small statements saying <i>“I was here”</i>. Tourists often bring stickers as a piece of home to their holiday destinations. Beyond these generic uses,
stickers are also territorial markers, especially among football fans <sup>1</sup>, or personal signatures,
comparable to graffiti tags. Some exist purely for advertising, while others express political demands or push specific narratives. <br>
What we see repeatedly shapes how we understand the world.
The more often we encounter something, the more it becomes integrated into our thinking, preferences, and navigation of everyday life—a phenomenon known as the mere exposure effect <sup>2</sup>(‘Mere Exposure Effect’, 2007). 
Stickers, though small and often overlooked, participate in this process.
